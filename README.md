Welcome to Titanium - Super Simple Chat Template

## Getting Started

First, create a new file in the root folder and name it `.env.local` provide your openAI API key. I tshould look something like this:
```
OPENAI_API_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
